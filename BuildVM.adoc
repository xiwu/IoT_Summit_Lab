== Scope
This document is intended for those people who would like to perform the
IoT-Lab, as described in this repository.

The instructions are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 (RHEL) running on a VM or a physical hardware.

== Pre-Requisite
You will need to install a RHEL V7.3 with:

 * 2 CPUs
 * 4 GB RAM ( more is always good )
 * 15 GB Storage

During the installation please select to install the server with GUI.

For simplicity we will use the default setting for the disk partitions.

Also make sure that your network is activated.

I usually create a user called "demo-user" with admin rights, but you can call
your user whatever you want.

After completing the install precedure, register and upgrade your RHEL installation:


```
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo subscription-manager register --username=rhnuser --password=rhnpasswd`
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo subscription-manager attach --pool=pool_id
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
[demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ sudo yum upgrade

```
== Provisioning the Gateway
=== Pre-Requisite

==== Install git

  [user@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install git

==== Install Ansible

  [user@localhost ~]$ sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  [user@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install ansible

==== Download JBOSS Fuse 6.3.0

Please download https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=46901[Red Hat JBoss Fuse V6.3.0]
and save it in the `Downloads` folder

==== Download JBoss BRMS V6.4.0

Please download https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/business-rules[JBoss BRMS]
and it's pre-requisites from the Red Hat Customer portal and place all three files
into the `Downloads` folder

 * https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=43891[JBoss EAP V7.0.0]
 * https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=49331[JBoss EAP V7.0.4 Patch]
 * https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=48291[Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.4.0 Deployable for EAP 7]

==== Clone the project

Download the project code from github

 [user@localhost ~]$ git clone https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Summit_Lab.git

==== Configure the Deployment Script

To customize the installation script to your needs, please update the file `IoT_Summit_Lab/Ansible/BuildGW`
and change the following value to the name of the user, who should be running the lab:

 set_fact: user='user name'

_Note: For the lab, we're using username = 'demo-user' and password = 'change12_me'._

==== Deploy Lab Environment

There are a few steps that need to be performed, before we can proceed with
running the lab.

====== Launch the Ansible playbook by entering the following commands:

  [user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/Ansible
  [user@localhost ~]$ ansible-playbook BuildGW --ask-become-pass

Let the Ansible run through the tasks in the playbook. Once Ansible is finished, we're ready to start work directly on the Gateway

_Note: If you want to provision the Gateway remotely, you will need to update the host file [Ansible/host] with IP address of the Gateway and place your public key on the Gateway https://github.com/redhat-iot/Virtual_IoT_Gateway/tree/Virtual-Lab-1-Host/Ansible[see details]_


====== Build supporting classes
Please run the following commands to build a Java Library, which is needed
by some of the other elements of this lab

 [user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/DataSet
 [user@localhost ~]$ mvn clean install

=== Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio
Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio ( JBDS ) is the Eclipse based tooling
for all JBoss products. It's capabilities can be installed onto an
existing Eclipse or already bundled.

For this setup, we will download JBDS from the https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html?product=jbossdeveloperstudio&downloadType=distributions[Red Hat Customer Portal] and save it in the Downloads folder

Once the download completed, you can run the installer for JBDS via.

 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ java -jar Downloads/devstudio-10.3.0.GA-installer-standalone.jar


For simplicity, accept all defaults and let the installer add an icon onto the desktop

image:images/install_jbds-new.png[]

If you want to take a first look at JBDS, let the installer start it, once
the installation completed

image:images/start_jbds-new.png[]

You can, again, accept the defaults for the proposed Eclipse 'workspace'.

It is up to you, if you want to let Red Hat receive usage statistics or not.

Once JBDS has fully started and the 'workspace' is shown, you will have to
switch to the panel to install additional software into JBDS

Select *JBoss Fuse Development* for installation.

image:images/jbds_install_tooling.png[]

After installing the Tooling and restarting JBDS, you can import the source
projects for the labs, to do so, perform the following steps

 * Open the 'Import' wizard of JBDS

image:images/import_1.png[]

 * Select 'Existing Maven Project' as import source

image:images/import_2.png[]

 * Select the '/home/demo-user/IoT_Summit_Lab/RoutingService' directory

image:images/import_3.png[]

 * Have patience or a cup of coffee, as JBDS downloads a lot of Maven dependencies for you.

 * Re-Do the same steps for the project in '/home/demo-user/IoT_Summit_Lab/BusinessRulesService'

*Now you are ready to proceed with the Labs! Have fun!*
