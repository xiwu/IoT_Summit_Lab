== Content

In this lab we will use the Software Sensor from Lab 3 to create a stream of sensordata and will observe the effect our Business Rules from Lab 4 has on the data.

In the Terminal session, run the following commands:

 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ cd
 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/
 [demo-user@iotlab IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runSensor.sh

You will see the sensordata being produced and received by the `Business Rules Service`, as
documented in the following image.

 * You can use the number of messages in the various Queues to verify that the
 `Business Rules Service` did filter the messages as expected. To do so,
 go back to your browser windows and navigate to the page showing the Queues
 and their content.

In this case, you can see that all produced 50 messages were place into and
consumed from the queue `message.to.rules` but not a single one was placed
into the queue `message.to.datacenter` by the `Business Rules Service`.

The reason for this are our implemented rules, which considered these values
to be in range and therefor not required for further processing.

* To get a different result you could update the rules 

Stop the running business rules service task by hitting CTRL-C in the right terminal session.

Update the business rules through the BRMS business-central portal as described in Lab Part 3. The updated rules should have three rows as shown in the following image

Save and then Build & Deploy the updated business rules as described in Lab Part 3 

== Building and Running the *Updated Business Rules Service*

You can use the same terminal again, to rebuild and start the *Updated Business Rules Service*

To do so, enter the following commands in your terminal session

 [demo-user@localhost IoT_Summit_Lab]$ cd
 [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/
 [demo-user@localhost IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runRulesService.sh
 

== Sending Sensor data
Lets send the sensordata stream again to test the updated rules service. 

To perform this test, perform the following steps

 * Open a new terminal windows

 [demo-user@localhost Desktop]$ cd
 [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/
 [demo-user@localhost IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runSensor.sh
 
Finally, check the number of messages per Queue in the JBoss Fuse Browser to validate that the new rules service is sending messages to message.to-datacenter queue.
